# NextJS Authentication System

This repository is the result of following a tutorial created by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://youtu.be/ETV17M4SauU?si=TFoP4hO6M4gQmdvF&t=1). The tutorial focuses on teaching the basics of Next.js, including its features, structure, and functionality. As a result, this project was created to implement an authentication system in Next.js applications.
